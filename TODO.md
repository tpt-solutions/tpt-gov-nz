# tpt-gov-nz — Task Tracker

> Legend: ✅ Done · 🔄 In progress · ⬜ Todo · 🎯 Demo-critical · ~~Removed~~

**Architecture:**
- **TypeScript** (Turbo + pnpm) — portals, packages, i18n, UI
- **Rust** (Cargo workspace) — API gateway, identity server, dept services, ingesters, federation

**Department pattern — straight to native, no adapters:**
```
gov-ingester-<id>   pulls from legacy system → writes to dept DB
gov-dept-<id>       owns the DB, serves data to portal + federation
portal-citizen/app/dept/<id>/   calls gov-dept-<id> directly
```
